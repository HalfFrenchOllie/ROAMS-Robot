Instruction Manual

The following instructions will go over the hardware and software procedures required to produce
and use the ROAMS robot.

Hardware Assembly
1. 3D Print the Parts:
• 3D print all the parts located in the parts folder.
2. Prepare Printed Parts:
• Clean off all support materials from the printed parts. Sand the parts where necessary.
3. Install Motors:
• Insert the motors into their respective mounts.
4. Prepare the Control Board:
• Cut off the ground pin and the 3.3V pin on the side of the board opposite the micro USB
port.
5. Complete the Wiring:
• Follow the wiring diagram provided in section A.2. Complete the wiring before assem-
bling the parts, as there won’t be enough space to insert the wires afterward.
• Verification: After assembly, power on the switch. You should see indicator lights on
both the control board and the motor driver board.
6. Attach the Motor Driver:
• Use 5mm M3 screws to secure the motor driver to the body of the robot.
7. Mount the Battery Holder and Control Board:
• Use 10mm M3 screws to attach the battery holder through its mounting holes, then
secure the control board to the body.
8. Install Bearings:
• Push-fit all the bearings into the legs.
9. Assemble the Legs:
• Align the legs to form the final two four-bar linkages.
10. Insert Aluminum Rods:
• Press the aluminum rods through the bearings and cut them to the appropriate length.
11. Attach Legs to Motor Shaft:
• Press the legs onto the motor shafts.

Completion: You now have a fully assembled ROAMS robot.

Software Setup (Arduino Only)
Note: To use Python or ROS, refer to the relevant instructions Python instructions or ROS
instructions.
1. Install ESP32 Board Package:
• Install the ESP32 board package in Arduino. Use version 2.0.17 by Espressif, as the
code may break with version 3.0 due to language changes.
2. Select the ESP32 Board:
• Plug the board into your computer and select ESP32 DEV MODULE from the board op-
tions.
3. Write or Upload Code:
• Either write your own code or use the provided code.
4. Upload the Code:
• While uploading:
– Hold down the BOOT button on your ESP32 board.
– Release the BOOT button after the “Connecting. . .” message appears in the
Arduino IDE.

Completion: Your code should now be successfully uploaded and functional.

Final Note: If all steps have been followed correctly, your ROAMS robot should be ready to
run any experiment you wish to conduct.
